Assumptions and Though Process

* The data provided appears to be stored in MongoDB so the foreign keys that are strings are using Mongo's ObjectId column.

* BrandCode references a partner file, for simplicity I'm assuming this could just be a relationship 
based on string equality so I am not diagramming it as a Foreign Key.

* There is a many-to-many relationship between Receipts and Items which is represented in my entity relationship diagram 
and vastly simplified as the data quality in `receipts.json` isn't great.
